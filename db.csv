Trust Stamp establishes trust in digital spaces by answering the questions ""Who are you?"" and ""Can I trust you?""",51-100,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trust-stamp,https://www.linkedin.com/company/trust-stamp/,"Trust Stamp recognizes the challenges increased digitization brings and has responded with solutions that provide users with a secure, private, and accessible identity. Trust Stamp establishes trust in a connected world, delivering trusted identity systems at the heart of how organizations and individuals transact. Trust Stamp enables enterprises to trust the identities they encounter and enables customers to trust that their identity is private and secure. Allowing good customers to transact more freely and keeping fraudsters out.

Trust Stamp answers the ultimate question of ‘Who am I dealing with?’. Is the person accessing the systems at that point in time, a real person and the right person? Trust Stamp’s patented technology enables businesses and public sector services to create trust and to protect themselves and their users, while empowering individuals to retain ownership of their data and prevent fraudulent activity using their identity. 

Trust Stamp’s biometric hashing technology enables enterprises to implement biometric convenience and security for their customers without the risk. Through our unique and patented technology, we convert biometric information into a cryptographic code. This eliminates the need to store any biometric information, making your biometric implementation more secure and privacy law-compliant.

","The Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token (IT2)
Trust Stamp has developed a unique and patent-protected Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token (IT2) to help protect biometric templates and personal data in general. The IT2 enhances security and privacy by converting biometric data into meaningless characters, which are of no use if they leak accidentally or are stolen by would-be identity thieves. A given IT2 cannot be reversed to recover the original data.



The main purpose of an IT2 is to enable the safe, private matching of a piece of Personal Data to a previously registered record. Any given IT2 taken out of context will generally be unlinkable to an individual. Thus, IT2 has the potential to transform the protection of biometric data against identity theft.



The IT2 is the product of unique award-winning research & development by Trust Stamp’s security scientists. IT2 tokens are irreversible. With the incorporation of a randomising seed which can be varied in the generation of each new token, IT2s are also revocable. IT2 tokenisation obviates the retention of biometric reference templates, improving privacy, reducing exposure to identity theft, and enhancing regulatory compliance.
